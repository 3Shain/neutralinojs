# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability in Neutralinojs components, please report as a Github [issue](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues).
After that, we'll add the `security` label to those issues and apply patches with a future release.

## How to download security patches

Neutralino binaries can be updated with [neu-cli](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/developer-environment/cli) from the developer's side. 
Therefore, if any vulnerability is reported against the Neutralinojs version you use, please update the existing binaries via CLI.
