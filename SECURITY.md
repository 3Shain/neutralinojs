# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Neutralino binaries can be updated with [neu-cli](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/#/tools/cli) easily in developer's side. 
Therefore, if any vulnerability is reported against the Neutralinojs version you use please update binaries via CLI.
Whereas, we are still working on software update [mechanism](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/268) in user's perspective where user can automatically update Neutralino binaries from internet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability in Neutralinojs component please report as a Github [issue](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues).
Thereafter, we'll add `security` label to those issues and will be fixed with a future release.
