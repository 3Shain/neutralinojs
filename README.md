NeutralinoJs is a portable and lightweight framework to develop apps with native functions and allows you to run inside web browsers. 

In electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs, hundreds of dependence libraries and also the bundled app size is large even we write `hello world` due to embedded chromium and Node runtime. Neutralino is lightweight solution for this issue.
